- Hold up at the camera:
  - The Drone - to see an alarm clock that displays the time
  - The Astronaut - to see a calandar displaying the date
  - The Fissure - to see a thermometer that displays the temperature as well as the humidity outside (Fissure note: you will need to sign-up for free at openweathermap in order to generate your own API key. This will allow you to get relevant data to your surrounding via a JSON file that one of the scripts I created in the Unity project reads).
  - The Oxygen - to see a windsock that [is supposed to] display the wind in mphs as well as the direction of the wind
